## Key Findings

### Single-Source Opportunities

**Opportunity 1:**
- Page 1: `{{DOCS_BASE_URL}}/guides-v15/staking`
- Page 2: `{{DOCS_BASE_URL}}/api-v15/sending-transactions-from-the-api`
- Analysis: After analyzing the two documentation sections, I found that there is significant overlap between the content of "Staking" in the guides-v15 section and "Sending Transactions from the API" in the api-v15 section. Here's a breakdown of the similarities:

1. **Similar content that could be consolidated:**
	* The sections on "Staking" and "Sending Transactions from the API" both cover the concept of staking, but from different angles. The guides-v15 section focuses on the user experience, while the api-v15 section explains how to implement staking via the API.
	* Both sections mention the concept of "staking policies" and the importance of having policies in place before staking.
	* The guides-v15 section has a subsection on "General Staking Flow" which is similar to the concept of "Sending Transactions from the API" in the api-v15 section.
2. **Estimated overlap percentage:**
	* I estimate that around 30-40% of the content in the guides-v15 section on "Staking" could be consolidated with the content in the api-v15 section on "Sending Transactions from the API".
3. **Identical vs slightly different:**
	* The term "staking policies" is identical in both sections.
	* The concept of "General Staking Flow" is similar, but the api-v15 section focuses more on the technical implementation via the API.
	* The guides-v15 section has a subsection on "Specific Coin Details" which is not present in the api-v15 section.
	* The api-v15 section has a subsection on "Staking Ethereum with Galaxy Validators" which is not present in the guides-v15 section.

To consolidate the content, you could create a new section that combines the relevant information from both sections, focusing on the user experience and technical implementation of staking. This would reduce duplication and make the documentation more concise and easier to navigate.

**Opportunity 2:**
- Page 1: `{{DOCS_BASE_URL}}/reference/disaster-recovery-procedures`
- Page 2: `{{DOCS_BASE_URL}}/guides-v15/staking`
- Analysis: After analyzing the two documentation sections, I've identified similar content that could be single-sourced. Here's the breakdown:

**Similar content:**

1. **Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery Procedures**: Both pages mention "Business Continuity" and "Disaster Recovery Procedures" in their titles and content.
2. **Staking**: Both pages mention "Staking" in their titles and content.
3. **Cold Vault**: Both pages reference the "Cold Vault" in their content, specifically in the context of staking and disaster recovery.

**Estimated overlap percentage:**

I estimate that approximately 20-30% of the content in both pages is identical or very similar. This is based on the presence of similar section titles, keywords, and phrases.

**Identical vs. slightly different content:**

1. **Identical content:** The section titles "Business Continuity" and "Disaster Recovery Procedures" are identical in both pages.
2. **Slightly different content:** The content related to "Staking" and "Cold Vault" is similar, but not identical. The "Staking" page provides more detailed information on staking policies, general staking flow, and specific coin details, whereas the "Disaster Recovery Procedures" page provides more general information on business continuity and disaster recovery.
3. **Unique content:** Each page has unique content that is not present in the other page. For example, the "Disaster Recovery Procedures" page has a section on "Offline Key Recovery" and "High Availability," which is not present in the "Staking" page.

**Consolidation suggestions:**

Based on the analysis, I suggest consolidating the following sections:

1. **Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery Procedures**: Create a single page that covers both topics, including the identical section titles and keywords.
2. **Staking**: Create a single page that provides a general overview of staking, including the section titles and keywords, and then provide more detailed information on specific coin details and staking policies in separate sections or sub-pages.

By consolidating these sections, you can reduce content duplication, improve user experience, and make it easier for users to find the information they need.

**Opportunity 3:**
- Page 1: `{{DOCS_BASE_URL}}/reference/gk8-glossary`
- Page 2: `{{DOCS_BASE_URL}}/guides-v15/staking`
- Analysis: After analyzing the two documentation sections, I've identified similar content that could be single-sourced. Here's the breakdown:

**Similar Content:**

1. **Glossary and Definitions**: Both pages have a glossary section that defines key terms related to cryptocurrency and {{COMPANY_NAME}} technology. Specifically:
	* Page 1 (reference): "General References" section
	* Page 2 (guides-v15): "Staking" page has a glossary-like section, but it's not explicitly labeled as such.
2. **Staking-related terms**: Both pages have terms related to staking, such as "staking", "tokenization", and "cold vault".
3. **{{COMPANY_NAME}}-specific terminology**: Both pages use {{COMPANY_NAME}}-specific terminology, such as "Impenetrable Vault", "Address", and "Application Programming Interface".

**Estimated Overlap Percentage:**

Based on the content, I estimate that approximately 20-30% of the content on both pages could be consolidated.

**Identical vs Slightly Different:**

1. **Identical:**
	* The term "Impenetrable Vault" is used on both pages with the same definition.
	* The term "Address" is used on both pages with the same definition.
2. **Slightly Different:**
	* The glossary section on Page 1 (reference) is more comprehensive, covering a broader range of cryptocurrency-related terms.
	* The staking-related terms on Page 2 (guides-v15) are more focused on the specific topic of staking, whereas the glossary on Page 1 (reference) provides a broader overview of cryptocurrency-related terms.

**Consolidation Opportunities:**

The following sections could be consolidated:

1. Create a single glossary section that combines the definitions from both pages, focusing on {{COMPANY_NAME}}-specific terminology and cryptocurrency-related terms.
2. Merge the staking-related terms from both pages into a single section, ensuring that the definitions are accurate and up-to-date.
3. Consider creating a single "Glossary" page that serves as a central resource for {{COMPANY_NAME}}-specific terminology and cryptocurrency-related terms.

**Opportunity 4:**
- Page 1: `{{DOCS_BASE_URL}}/reference/cold-driven-policy-exercises`
- Page 2: `{{DOCS_BASE_URL}}/api-v15/anti-money-laundering-aml-api-implementation`
- Analysis: After analyzing the two documentation sections, I identified several areas of overlap that could be consolidated. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Similar content:**
	* Both pages mention "Anti-Money Laundering (AML)" in their titles and content.
	* The concept of "Security" is also mentioned in both pages, specifically in the context of the {{COMPANY_NAME}} platform's self-custody technology and AML implementation.
2. **Consolidation opportunities:**
	* The "Getting Started" sections on both pages could be merged, as they both provide introductory information about the {{COMPANY_NAME}} platform and its API.
	* The "Troubleshooting" sections on both pages could also be consolidated, as they both provide guidance on resolving issues related to the {{COMPANY_NAME}} platform and its API.
3. **Estimated overlap percentage:**
	* Based on the content samples provided, I estimate that approximately 30% of the content on both pages could be consolidated.
4. **Identical vs. slightly different content:**
	* The "Introduction" sections on both pages are identical, with the same text and structure.
	* The "Anti-Money Laundering (AML) API Implementation" sections on both pages have similar content, but the v15 page provides more detailed information about the AML API implementation in version 15 of the {{COMPANY_NAME}} API.
	* The "Getting Started" sections on both pages have similar content, but the v15 page provides more specific information about creating a Mainnet API user from the desktop app or cold vault.

To consolidate the similar content, I would suggest the following:

* Merge the "Getting Started" sections to provide a unified introduction to the {{COMPANY_NAME}} platform and its API.
* Consolidate the "Troubleshooting" sections to provide a single resource for resolving issues related to the {{COMPANY_NAME}} platform and its API.
* Remove duplicate content, such as the identical "Introduction" sections, to reduce the overall length of the documentation.
* Update the v15 page to include the additional information about the AML API implementation in version 15 of the {{COMPANY_NAME}} API, while removing any duplicate content from the original page.

**Opportunity 5:**
- Page 1: `{{DOCS_BASE_URL}}/reference/mpc-driven-policy-exercises`
- Page 2: `{{DOCS_BASE_URL}}/api-v15/collector-usage`
- Analysis: After analyzing the two documentation sections, I've identified similar content that could be single-sourced. Here are the results:

**Similar content:**

1. **Getting Started**
	* Page 1: "Getting Started" section is present in the reference page, while Page 2 has a "Getting Started with the {{COMPANY_NAME}} API" section. These could be consolidated into a single "Getting Started" section.
2. **User Management**
	* Page 1: "Users, roles, and groups are all managed from the User Management area of the desktop app." (from "MPC-Driven Policy Exercises" section)
	* Page 2: "User Management" is a separate section, but it's likely that the content could be merged with the Page 1 section.
3. **Business Logic**
	* Page 1: "In MPC-Driven mode, the most straightforward order to build your business logic into the system is to follow the sequence of User, Role, Group, and Policy Logic."
	* Page 2: This section is not present, but the concept of building business logic is mentioned in the "Collector Usage" section.
4. **API Client**
	* Page 1: "In MPC-Driven mode, the most straightforward order to build your business logic into the system is to follow the sequence of User, Role, Group, and Policy Logic." (from "MPC-Driven Policy Exercises" section)
	* Page 2: "ApiClientExample API Journeys API Client Pool" - these sections could be merged into a single "API Client" section.
5. **Staking**
	* Page 1: "Staking" is mentioned in the "MPC-Driven Policy Exercises" section.
	* Page 2: "Staking Ethereum with Galaxy Validators" and "Fee Optimization - Merge UTXO Galaxy ETH Staking" - these sections could be merged into a single "Staking" section.
6. **AML (Anti-Money Laundering)**
	* Page 1: "Anti-Money Laundering Roles" is mentioned in the "MPC-Driven Policy Exercises" section.
	* Page 2: "Anti-Money Laundering (AML) API Implementation" - these sections could be merged into a single "AML" section.
7. **Webhook**
	* Page 1: No mention of Webhook.
	* Page 2: "Securing Webhook Communications" and "Webhook v2 Output" - these sections could be merged into a single "Webhook" section.

**Estimated overlap percentage:**

Based on the analysis, I estimate that approximately 40% of the content between the two pages could be consolidated.

**Identical vs slightly different:**

* Most of the content is slightly different, with some sections having similar titles but different content.
* Some sections, like "Getting Started" and "User Management", have identical or very similar content.
* Other sections, like "Staking" and "AML", have similar but not identical content.

Please note that the estimated overlap percentage is subjective and may vary depending on the specific requirements and goals of the documentation.
